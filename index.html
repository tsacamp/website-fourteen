<h1><h1 style=font-size:500%;font-family:Corbel;text-align:center>Smithsonian vs. Field museum</h1>

<p> <p style=font-size:350%;font-family:Corbel;text-align:left>
No hate on the Smithsonian, but the diversity between dinosaurs is pretty absent. There is only 5 types of land dinosaurs, 1 diplodocus, two T.rex's, two triceratops, and 1 stegosaurus, and 1 allosaurus. I honestly set my expectations way too high because I use to have amazing book about dinosaurs made by smithsonian and it got into my head that they had all the dinos in that book in their museum so I was a little disappointed. They did have a thing with a T.Rex attacking a triceratops which was pretty cool to see, I must admit.</p>

<h2><h2 style=font-size:500%;font-family:Corbel;text-align:center>I'm a dinosaur nerd</h2>
<p><p style=font-size:350%;font-family:Corbel;text-align:left>
Ever since I was 4 years old I always had an obsession with dinosaurs. I remember correcting my preschool teacher when she mispronounced a dinosaur's name. I had a bunch of books about dinosaurs, how many fossils they have, what they ate, and how big they were. I just loved dinosaurs, mostly because the fact that these humongous, terrifying, absolutely cool looking beasts actually existed amazed me. I don't have a favorite dinosaur, but my favorite species of dino is probably the ceratopsians, because they were probably the coolest looking (because of their horns and frill) and were one of the few herbivores that could defend themselves if a theropod like a Spinosaurus or T.rex decided they were lookin like a snack. I also would look at the news if some fossils of some dinosaur were discovered. </p>

<h3><h3 style=font-size:500%;font-family:Corbel;text-align:center>There are 700+ species of dinosaurs, but I'm only teaching about a couple of species. You're welcome(herbivore edition)</h3>
<p><p style=font-size:350%;font-family:Corbel;text-align:left>
The first species I will spit some facts about will be the most popular ceratopsian, the Triceratops. This dinosaur is the biggest ceratopsian to ever exist, being 26 feet to 30 feet long, and 9.5 to 10 feet tall, and a young triceratops being 13k lbs and an adult being 26k lbs. The fossils of triceratops were mainly found in North America, and it also lived in the cretaceous time period with the T.Rex. The Triceratops had three horns hence the name TRIceratops. One above each eye and one on its nose. The first Triceratops fossil was found in Denver. Another cool fact is that there is fossil evidence of a T.Rex and a Triceratops fighting (not surprising) but there was a crack and hole found in the bone of a T.Rex made by a Triceratops, showing that this huge, strong theropod fought a Triceratops and lost badly. Another strong herbivore is the ankylosaurus. This ankylosaur had a huge club made of bone on its tail, and a body covered by extremely protective and strong fused bone. These peculiar traits were essential in defending itself from theropods like the Tyrannosaurus. This dino was from 20 to 26 feet long, and weighed 5 to 8 tons. This dinosaur lived along with the triceratops and T.Rex in the late cretaceous. This dinosaur has also been attacked by a vicious carnivore but instead of being eaten, has killed its attacker by slamming its hard, powerful tail with a club on the end and shattering its predators bones. There is fossil evidence of this.   </p>

More dinosaur facts (carnivore edition)     </h4>
<p><p style=font-size:350%;font-family:Corbel;text-align:left>
This dinosaur is one the biggest carnivores to ever exist. This dinosaur is the spinosaurus. This dinosaur was 14 to 23 feet tall, 15k lbs to 46k lbs, and 49 to 52 feet long. It also is a crocodile relative, based on the shape of its skull. It hands were webbed and made for catching fish and swimming, as well stabbing deep into other dinosaurs with its long, sharp claws and 3 inch+ long teeth. a peculiar trait about this dinosaur was it had bones sticking up from its spine covered in fat. It lived in North Africa during its time, which was the albian- campanian time period.      </p>

<h5><h5 style=font-size:500%;font-family:Corbel;text-align:center>Why I chose this theme</h5>
<p><p style=font-size:350%;font-family:Corbel;text-align:left>
I chose this theme because of my profound interest in dinosaurs, and I thought it would be cool to give you some information about some of them so you could learn and maybe be as interested as I am in dinosaurs. Thank you for reading this. Hope you enjoyed!</p>
